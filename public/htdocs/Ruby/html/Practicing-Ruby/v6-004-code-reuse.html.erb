    <p>% Code reuse in Ruby – It’s complicated 
% Gregory Brown (practicingruby.com)
% February 12, 2013</p>

<p>\begin{abstract} 
Ruby provides at least seven common ways of reusing code, all of them with their
own strengths and weaknesses. However, the main thing that separates these
various techniques is whether they are a form of \emph{implementation sharing} or a
form of \emph{behavior sharing}. This article explains what distinguishes those
two categories, the kinds of complexities that can arise from each of
them, and some practical recommendations that you can apply to reusing code
within your own projects.
\end{abstract}</p>

<h1 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h1>

<p>As a deeply object-oriented programming language, Ruby permits code reuse in
more ways than most languages. When put in the right hands, Ruby’s flexibility
is extremely powerful, allowing us to model our systems any way we want.
But with great power comes great responsibility.</p>

<p>If not used carefully, Ruby’s code reuse mechanisms can quickly erode most (if
not all) of the benefits that object-oriented design is meant to offer us. The
larger our systems get, the easier it is for things to spiral out of control.
But the truth is that most codebases don’t start out as an unmaintainable mess, 
nor do they suddenly turn bad overnight.
Instead, they erode gradually – one poor decision at a time.</p>

<p>In this article, we’ll discuss the various pitfalls of Ruby’s code reuse
methods. My hope is that by studying these issues, you’ll be more aware of the 
risks involved in certain modeling decisions, and that will help you better 
understand the compromises you must make while designing your projects.</p>

<h1 id="common-methods-of-code-reuse">2. Common methods of code reuse</h1>

<p>Ruby’s code sharing methods can be divided into two groups: those that
provide direct access to the internals of the shared component (<em>implementation
sharing</em>), and those that do not (<em>behavior sharing</em>). While each approach has
its own set of costs and benefits, a lot can be said about the
complexity of a technique by knowing which reuse category it belongs to.</p>

<h2 id="implementation-sharing-techniques">2.1 Implementation sharing techniques</h2>

<p>The following techniques reuse code in ways that provide
direct access to internals:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>inheriting</strong> from a superclass</li>
  <li><strong>including</strong> a module into a class</li>
  <li><strong>extending</strong> an individual object using a module</li>
  <li><strong>patching</strong> a class or individual object directly</li>
  <li><strong>evaluating</strong> code in the context of a class or individual object</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="behavior-sharing-techniques">2.2 Behavior sharing techniques</h2>

<p>The following techniques rely on message passing
between distinct objects for code sharing, limiting 
direct access to internals:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>decorating</strong> an object using a dynamic proxy</li>
  <li><strong>composing</strong> objects using simple aggregation</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="reference-examples">2.3 Reference examples</h2>

<p>Our goal is only to discuss the complexities
of implementation sharing and behavior sharing in general,
so you don’t need to be familiar with all seven methods
of code reuse listed above in order to understand
the rest of this article.</p>

<p>However, if you want some additional clarification about what
each of these terms mean, you can check out <a href="https://gist.github.com/sandal/4755113">this set of
code-reuse examples</a>.</p>

<h1 id="complexities-of-implementation-sharing">3. Complexities of implementation sharing</h1>

<p>An entire book can be written about the complexities involved in sharing
functionality without proper encapsulation between components. However,
since we don’t have room for that level of detail in this article, I’ve
attempted to group the common issues together into three broad areas 
of concern to look out for: shared instance variables, shared method
definitions, and combinatorial effects.</p>

<h2 id="shared-instance-variables">3.1 Shared instance variables</h2>

<p>Each object has a single set of instance variables, even if it
has a very complex ancestry chain. For example,
the following code references an instance variable that was
defined by its superclass:</p>

<div class="highlighter-coderay"><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>require <span style="background-color:hsla(0,100%,50%,0.05)"><span style="color:#710">&quot;</span><span style="color:#D20">ostruct</span><span style="color:#710">&quot;</span></span>

<span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">class</span> <span style="color:#B06;font-weight:bold">PrettyStruct</span> &lt; <span style="color:#036;font-weight:bold">OpenStruct</span>
  <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">def</span> <span style="color:#06B;font-weight:bold">inspect</span>
    <span style="color:#33B">@table</span>.map { |k,v| <span style="background-color:hsla(0,100%,50%,0.05)"><span style="color:#710">&quot;</span><span style="background-color:hsla(0,0%,0%,0.07);color:black"><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#666">#{</span>k<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#666">}</span></span><span style="color:#D20"> = </span><span style="background-color:hsla(0,0%,0%,0.07);color:black"><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#666">#{</span>v.inspect<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#666">}</span></span><span style="color:#710">&quot;</span></span> }.join(<span style="background-color:hsla(0,100%,50%,0.05)"><span style="color:#710">&quot;</span><span style="color:#b0b">\n</span><span style="color:#710">&quot;</span></span>)
  <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">end</span>
<span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">end</span>

struct = <span style="color:#036;font-weight:bold">PrettyStruct</span>.new(<span style="color:#A60">:a</span> =&gt; <span style="color:#00D">3</span>, <span style="color:#A60">:b</span> =&gt; <span style="color:#00D">4</span>, <span style="color:#A60">:c</span> =&gt; <span style="color:#00D">5</span>)
p struct

<span style="color:#777"># a = 3</span>
<span style="color:#777"># b = 4</span>
<span style="color:#777"># c = 5</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When two or more shared components reference the same
instance variable, it may be intentional or unintentional.
It goes without saying that unintentional variable name
collisions can lead to defects that are hard to debug, but
intentional shared access (such as in the snippet above)
has more subtle issues to consider. </p>

<p>Whenever we directly access a variable rather than using 
a public accessor, we may be skipping validations, 
transformations, caching features, or concurrency-related 
features that are meant to keep the underlying data
consistent and synchronized. Is a simple read-only reference
such as the one we’ve done here really that risky? The
truth is, there’s no way to know without reading the <code>OpenStruct</code>
source code.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the only way to know for sure what instance variables 
will be defined, accessed, and modified at runtime for <em>any</em>
Ruby object is to read the source of every single class and
module that is in its ancestry chain, both at the
individual object and class definition level. Because new variables 
can spring into existence any time a method is called, this kind 
of static analyis is not practical for most non-trivial programs. </p>

<p>At the extreme end of the spectrum, you have objects that inherit
from <code>ActiveRecord::Base</code>; they exist at the tail end of
an ancestry chain that provides several instance variables and
hundreds of methods through dozens of modules, and that’s assuming 
that you haven’t installed any third-party plugins. If you aren’t 
convinced by the trivial example I’ve shown in this article, spend 
some time with the Rails source code and you’ll surely get the point.</p>

<h2 id="shared-method-definitions">3.2 Shared method definitions</h2>

<p>Even when reusing an ancestor’s public API, it can be challenging to 
avoid strange inconsistencies. Bob Martin provided a classic example
of this problem in an article on the <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/lsp.pdf">Liskov Substitution
Principle</a>.
Consider a <code>Rectangle</code> class with a <code>Square</code> subclass, as shown
below:</p>

<div class="highlighter-coderay"><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre><span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">class</span> <span style="color:#B06;font-weight:bold">Rectangle</span>
  <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">def</span> <span style="color:#06B;font-weight:bold">initialize</span>(width, height)
    <span style="color:#069">self</span>.width   = width
    <span style="color:#069">self</span>.height  = height
  <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">end</span>

  attr_accessor <span style="color:#A60">:width</span>, <span style="color:#A60">:height</span>

  <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">def</span> <span style="color:#06B;font-weight:bold">area</span>
    width * height
  <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">end</span>
<span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">end</span>

<span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">class</span> <span style="color:#B06;font-weight:bold">Square</span> &lt; <span style="color:#036;font-weight:bold">Rectangle</span>
  <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">def</span> <span style="color:#06B;font-weight:bold">initialize</span>(size)
    <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">super</span>(size, size)
  <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">end</span>
<span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">end</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>On the surface, this implementation looks simple, and seems to work 
as expected:</p>

<div class="highlighter-coderay"><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>square = <span style="color:#036;font-weight:bold">Square</span>.new(<span style="color:#00D">5</span>)

p square.area                   <span style="color:#777">#=&gt; 25</span>
p [square.width, square.height] <span style="color:#777">#=&gt; [5, 5]</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But there is also the potential for bad behavior here, because the <code>Square</code> class
also inherits <code>Rectangle#width=</code> and <code>Rectangle#height=</code>, which can lead
to inconsistent data in the <code>Square</code> object:</p>

<div class="highlighter-coderay"><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>square.width = <span style="color:#00D">10</span>

p [square.width, square.height] <span style="color:#777">#=&gt; [10, 5] -- not a square!</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>One way to resolve this issue would be to override <code>Rectangle#width=</code> 
and <code>Rectangle#height=</code> so that the two values are synchronized:</p>

<div class="highlighter-coderay"><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre><span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">class</span> <span style="color:#B06;font-weight:bold">Square</span> &lt; <span style="color:#036;font-weight:bold">Rectangle</span>
  <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">def</span> <span style="color:#06B;font-weight:bold">initialize</span>(size)
    <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">super</span>(size, size)
  <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">end</span>

  <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">def</span> <span style="color:#06B;font-weight:bold">width=</span>(size)
    <span style="color:#33B">@width</span>   = size
    <span style="color:#33B">@height</span>  = size
  <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">end</span>

  <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">def</span> <span style="color:#06B;font-weight:bold">height=</span>(size)
    <span style="color:#33B">@width</span>   = size
    <span style="color:#33B">@height</span>  = size
  <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">end</span>
<span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">end</span>

square = <span style="color:#036;font-weight:bold">Square</span>.new(<span style="color:#00D">5</span>)

square.width = <span style="color:#00D">10</span>
p [square.width, square.height] <span style="color:#777">#=&gt; [10, 10]</span>
p square.area                   <span style="color:#777">#=&gt; 100</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This change enables the kind of behavior you might expect from a <code>Square</code>,
and if you are simply reusing code to keep things DRY, that might be good
enough. However, there may still be some subtle issues in code which assumes
that a rectangle’s height can vary independently of its width, such as in
this test code:</p>

<div class="highlighter-coderay"><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre><span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">def</span> <span style="color:#06B;font-weight:bold">test_area</span>
  rect.width  = <span style="color:#00D">5</span>
  rect.height = <span style="color:#00D">10</span>

  assert <span style="color:#00D">50</span>, rect.area
<span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">end</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Arguably, this test is written poorly if it is meant to be used as a shared
example for all descendents of the <code>Rectangle</code> object. The problem is that at a
first glance, the flaw is not at all obvious. And that essentially is the
core challenge in inheritance-based modeling: ancestors must
guess about the kinds of ways that they will be extended, and descendents need
to guess about whether their extensions will break upstream features. With
some practice and careful design thought this is possible, but it certainly
is not <em>easy</em> to reason about.</p>

<h2 id="combinatorial-effects">3.3 Combinatorial effects</h2>

<p>Shared method definitions and shared instance variables are at the root of what
makes implementation sharing complex, but that complexity is compounded by the 
fact that ancestry chains can grow arbitrarily long. Module mixins in particular
tend to cause this problem, because they are typically viewed by Ruby programmers
as a tool for implementing orthogonal <em>plugins</em>, but are functionally more similar 
to <em>multiple inheritance</em>.</p>

<p>Consider an arbitrary class C, with four modules mixed into it: M~1~,
M~2~, M~3~, and M~4~. Typically, each of these modules will provide some
features to C and perhaps require that C implement a few methods to enable those
features. Since each of these modules is meant to be used standalone, they
aren’t directly aware of one another, nor do they depend on each other’s
features. </p>

<p>In this scenario, each module might need to make
calls to C’s public API and vice-versa, but there would be no need for the
modules to be able to call each other’s public methods directly. Furthermore,
in an ideal situation, C and its mixed-in modules would communicate entirely via
public method calls, allowing each to have their own private methods and
internal state. If these constraints were enforced at the language level, it’d be 
possible to model mixins as a simple, horizontal lookup path that would be 
trivial to reason about.</p>

<p>From our perspective as Ruby users, the scenario described above might cover 90%
of what we use modules for on a day to day basis. But because modules are
actually a much more powerful and generalized construct, we cannot expect that
simplistic mental model to be a good fit for how they actually work. In reality,
every module we mix into a class has direct access to the variables and methods
defined by every other mixed in module in that class, resulting in a
combinatorial explosion of possible interactions.</p>

<p>The following graph attempts to illustrate the difference between our typical
way of thinking about (and using) modules, and how they actually work:</p>

<p><strong>(see next page)</strong></p>

<p>\newpage</p>

<p><img src="topology.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>What you see above is just one small slice of the total method lookup path, but
it illustrates the general problem that repeats itself along the whole chain:
every ancestor can access the internals of every other, and the number of 
possibilities expands greatly with each new component added to the chain.</p>

<p>In practice, when concerns really are orthogonal, most of the combinatorial
effects between components can safely be ignored as long as you apply some
informal reasoning. But as an object gets larger, it becomes more likely
that some pair of ancestors will accidentally develop conflicting
definitions of what a method or variable is meant to be used for, and those
issues can be very difficult to debug. Furthermore, each new ancestor
also makes it harder to add new functionality to an object without 
accidentally breaking existing features.</p>

<p>This issue can be mitigated by the use of mixins at the individual object level,
which can allow different bits of reusable functionality to be used in isolation
of one another by only mixing in one module at at a time. However, this technique
only works around the issue – it does not eliminate it entirely.</p>

<h1 id="complexities-of-behavior-sharing">4. Complexities of behavior sharing</h1>

<p>Behavior sharing techniques do not suffer from any of the issues we’ve
discussed so far, and that alone makes them worth considering as a better
default approach. However, they do have their own share of problems, 
so you need to be aware of what the tradeoffs are when deciding how to 
model your systems.</p>

<h2 id="indirect-access">4.1 Indirect access</h2>

<p>When access to an object’s internals is truly necessary, it isn’t practical
to use composition based techniques. For example, consider the following
mixin-based code which implements a memoization routine for caching method
return values:</p>

<div class="highlighter-coderay"><div class="CodeRay">

<p>A naive attempt to refactor the <code>Cached</code> module into a <code>ComposedCache</code> class
might end up looking something like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-coderay"><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre><span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">class</span> <span style="color:#B06;font-weight:bold">ComposedCache</span>

      results = {}

      define_singleton_method(m) <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">do</span> |*a|
        results[a] ||= <span style="color:#33B">@target</span>.send(m, *a)
      <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">end</span>
    <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">end</span>
  <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">end</span>

(<span style="color:#00D">0</span>..<span style="color:#00D">100</span>).each { |e| p [e, n.fib(e)] }
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Unfortunately, this code has a critical flaw in it that makes it unsuitable 
for general use: It caches calls made through the <code>ComposedCache</code> proxy, but
it does not cache internal calls made within the objects it wraps. In 
practice, this makes it absolutely useless for optimizing the performance of
recursive functions such as the <code>fib()</code> method we’re working with here.</p>

<p>There is no way around this problem without modifying the wrapped object.
In order to stick with composition-based modeling and still get proper
caching behavior, here’s what we’d need to do: </p>

<div class="highlighter-coderay"><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre><span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">class</span> <span style="color:#B06;font-weight:bold">ComposedCache</span>

    <span style="color:#33B">@target</span>  = target
  <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">end</span>

  <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">def</span> <span style="color:#06B;font-weight:bold">cache</span>(*method_names)
    method_names.each <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">do</span> |m|
      original = <span style="color:#33B">@target</span>.method(m)
      results  = {}

      <span style="color:#33B">@target</span>.define_singleton_method(m) <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">do</span> |*a|
        results[a] ||= original.call(*a)
      <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">end</span>

      define_singleton_method(m) { |*a| <span style="color:#33B">@target</span>.send(m, *a) }
    <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">end</span>
  <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">end</span>
<span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">end</span>

n = <span style="color:#036;font-weight:bold">ComposedCache</span>.new(<span style="color:#036;font-weight:bold">Numbers</span>.new)
n.cache(<span style="color:#A60">:fib</span>)
  
(<span style="color:#00D">0</span>..<span style="color:#00D">100</span>).each { |e| p [e, n.fib(e)] }
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Such a design <em>would</em> prevent a new ancestor from being introduced
into the <code>Numbers</code> object’s lookup path, and it would externalize
the code that actually understands how to handle the caching. However,
because <code>ComposedCache</code> still directly modifies the behavior of
the <code>Numbers</code> objects it wraps, it loses the benefit of encapsulation
that typically comes along with composition based modeling.</p>

<p>We also end up with an interface that feels awkward: defining what
methods ought to be cached via an instance method call does not
feel nearly as natural as using a class-level macro, and might
be cumbersome to integrate within a real project. There are ways
to improve this interface, but that would require us to jump through
a few more hoops, increasing the complexity of the implementation.</p>

<p>Because the <code>ComposedCache</code> expects all cached methods to be explicitly
declared and it does not support automatic delegation to the underlying
object, it might be cumbersome to work with – it would either need
to be modified to forward all uncached method calls to the object it
wraps (losing the benefits of a narrow surface), or the caller would
need to keep both a reference to the original object and the composed 
cache object around (which is very awkward and confusing!).</p>

<p>Good composition-based modeling produces code that is simpler than
the sum of its parts, as a direct result of strong encapsulation
and well-defined interactions between collaborators. Unfortunately,
our implementation of the <code>ComposedCache</code> class has none of those 
benefits, and so it serves as a useful (if pathological) example 
of the downsides of composition-based modeling.</p>

<h2 id="self-schizophrenia">4.2 Self-schizophrenia</h2>

<p>When sharing behavior via decorators, it can sometimes be tricky to remember
what <code>self</code> refers to. This can happen both on the proxy side (a reference to
<code>self</code> accidentally refers to the proxy rather than the target), and
within the target object (a reference to <code>self</code> accidentally exposes the
target rather than the proxy). This common mistake can lead to subtle bugs 
that are tricky to detect.</p>

<p>A clear example of this problem can be found in the Celluloid concurrency
framework. Pay attention to the lines marked #1 and #2 in the following
code:</p>

<p><strong>(see next page)</strong>
\newpage</p>

<div class="highlighter-coderay"><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>require <span style="background-color:hsla(0,100%,50%,0.05)"><span style="color:#710">&quot;</span><span style="color:#D20">celluloid</span><span style="color:#710">&quot;</span></span>

<span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">class</span> <span style="color:#B06;font-weight:bold">Alert</span>
  include <span style="color:#036;font-weight:bold">Celluloid</span>

  <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">def</span> <span style="color:#06B;font-weight:bold">initialize</span>(message, delay)
    <span style="color:#33B">@message</span> = message
    <span style="color:#33B">@delay</span>   = delay
    <span style="color:#33B">@display</span> = <span style="color:#036;font-weight:bold">Display</span>.new
  <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">end</span>

  <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">def</span> <span style="color:#06B;font-weight:bold">run</span>

      <span style="color:#33B">@display</span>.async.render(<span style="color:#036;font-weight:bold">Actor</span>.current)  <span style="color:#777"># 1</span>
    <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">end</span>
  <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">end</span>
<span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">end</span>

<span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">class</span> <span style="color:#B06;font-weight:bold">Display</span>
  include <span style="color:#036;font-weight:bold">Celluloid</span>

  <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">def</span> <span style="color:#06B;font-weight:bold">render</span>(actor)
    puts actor.message
  <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">end</span>
<span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">end</span>

alert = <span style="color:#036;font-weight:bold">Alert</span>.new(<span style="background-color:hsla(0,100%,50%,0.05)"><span style="color:#710">&quot;</span><span style="color:#D20">Foo</span><span style="color:#710">&quot;</span></span>, <span style="color:#00D">5</span>)
alert.async.run <span style="color:#777"># 2</span>

sleep
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the line marked #1, the <code>Actor.current</code> method is called, rather than
referring to <code>self</code>. This is a direct effect of Celluloid relying on a proxy
mechanism for handling its fault tolerance and concurrency functionality.</p>

<p>When <code>alert.async.run</code> is called on the line marked #2, <code>Alert#run</code> is not
executed directly, but instead gets scheduled to be run indirectly by a proxy object.
However, once the method is actually executed, <code>self</code> refers to the <code>Alert</code>
object, not the proxy object that enables it to be used in a
concurrent, thread-safe way. Celluloid ensures that the <code>Actor.current</code> method
will return a reference to that proxy object, and this is how you can safely pass 
a reference to an object that you’re using Celluloid with.</p>

<p>If this design technique sounds awkward, it’s because it is. However, there
isn’t really a better composition-based workaround: this kind of complexity
arises from the indirect access problem that we discussed in the previous section, and
is worsened by the automatic delegation that is meant to make two distinct
objects appear as if they were one single coherent entity.</p>

<p>When faced with the self-schizophrenia issue, it’s important to consider how
much benefit is gained by encapsulating implementation details. In the case of
Celluloid, the benefit of not mixing complicated concurrency mechanics into
ordinary objects is probably well worth it, but in other cases it may make
sense to use an implementation sharing approach instead.</p>

<p><em>NOTE: The self-schizophrenia problem also can occur when using the <strong>eval</strong>
implementation sharing approach. However, since it not a general problem for
that category, I’ve categorized it as more of a behavior sharing problem.</em></p>

<h2 id="lack-of-established-design-practices">4.3 Lack of established design practices</h2>

<p>Although it is not a technical issue, one of the main barriers to making
effective use of behavior sharing in Ruby is that most
developers are simply not comfortable with using aggregation as a primary
modeling technique. Ruby has lots of tools that make this style of programming
easier, but they tend to take a back seat to module mixins and eval-based 
domain-specific interfaces.</p>

<p>Decorators and simple composition are definitely gaining in popularity due to
the encapsulation and understandability benefits that they offer, but in many
cases they are used as direct replacements for inheritance-based modeling. This
leads to somewhat high-ceremony and awkward interfaces that aren’t necessarily
convenient or comfortable to use.</p>

<p>In other words, we haven’t yet established idioms or practices that truly allow
composition based modeling to shine: most of our libraries and frameworks still
heavily rely on implementation sharing techniques, and until that changes, our
applications will tend to follow in their footsteps.</p>

<p>This is an issue that will hopefully be resolved in time, but for now I think
it’s only fair to include a lack of familiarity with behavior sharing methods as
something that makes code that uses them more complicated to reason about.</p>

<h1 id="notes-and-recommendations">5. Notes and recommendations</h1>

<p>Implementation sharing is very powerful, and that makes it a good deal more
complex than behavior sharing by default. To decide which style of code reuse is
better to use in a given situation, it makes sense to ask yourself whether your
code actually needs direct access to the internals of its ancestors.</p>

<p>In the rare cases where direct access is needed, it makes sense to use as weak
of a form of implementation sharing as possible. Techniques which limit global
effects are most desireable, e.g. individual object mixins, eval-based domain
specific interfaces, and adding methods directly to individual objects. But
if you find that the setup for these techniques ends up introducing needless
complexity, including a module into a class or
inheriting from a base class is still an option. No matter what
technique you choose, it’s best to not directly rely on instance variables or
private methods from ancestors, just to play it safe.</p>

<p>However, you might find that most of the problems you currently solve with
implementation sharing methods could fairly easily be solved with a
behavior sharing approach. If a little extra work is
likely to save you maintenance effort in the future, and it makes the code
easier to reason about, it makes sense to reach for simple composition based
modeling by default. Using a dynamic decorator can also offer a reasonable 
middle ground when you are trying to build an object that can serve as a
drop-in replacement for some other component.</p>

<p>If you try to go the behavior sharing route and find it’s too complicated or
that it has obvious drawbacks (such as in the caching example we discussed in
this article), you can always go back to implementation sharing techniques.
However, since most of the issues with behavior sharing tend to happen along the
edge cases, and the issues with implementation sharing are baked into its core,
it does make sense to try to avoid the latter where possible.</p>

<p>Much more research into this problem is needed. If you’d like to discuss it with
me, don’t hesitate to drop a message on the conversation thread over at
practicingruby.com, or email me at <strong>gregory@practicingruby.com</strong>.</p>

<h1 id="further-reading">6. Further reading</h1>

<p>There are three papers I’d recommend if you want to study these issues further:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Disciplined inheritance, M. Sakkinen 1989</em></li>
  <li><em>A behavioral notion of subtyping, Liskov / Wing 1994</em></li>
  <li><em>Out of the tar pit, Moseley 2006</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The first two papers deal squarely with the issues of implementation sharing vs.
behavior sharing in code reuse, and the third provides a more general inquiry
into what makes our programs difficult to reason about. All three are more
formal than this article, but also much more in-depth.</p>

<p>For a Ruby-centric summary of the first two papers, see <a href="https://practicingruby.com/articles/shared/uvgdkprzmoqf">Issue

the insight to be gained from the papers listed above.</p>
