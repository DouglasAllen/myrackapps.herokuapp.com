  <p>This issue was a collaboration with my wife, Jia Wu. Jia is an associate
scientist at the Yale Child Study Center, where she spends a good portion of
her time analyzing brainwave data from various EEG experiments. Although
this article focuses on very basic concepts, her background in 
statistical programming was very helpful whenever I got stuck on 
something. That said, if you find any mistakes in this article, you
can blame me, not her.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Statistics and programming go hand in hand, but the kinds of problems we tend to
work on in Ruby make it easy to overlook this point. If your work does not 
involve a lot of data analysis, you may not feel much pain even if you have a very 
limited math background. However, as our world becomes increasingly data-driven, 
a working knowledge of statistics can really come in handy.</p>

<p>In this article, I will walk you through a simple example of how you can use 
two very basic statistical methods (correlation + significance testing) to 
explore your own questions about the patterns you notice in the world. 
Although we won’t dig too deeply into underlying math involved in these
concepts, I will try to provide you with enough background information to 
start trying out your own experiments even if you have never formally 
studied statistics before.</p>

<p>The example that I’ll share with you explores the connection between
the economic strength and population of nations and their performance in 
recent Olympic games. In order to interpret the (rudimentary) analysis I did, 
you’ll need to understand what a correlation coefficient is, and what it means 
for a result to be statistically significant. If you are familiar with those 
concepts, feel free to skim or skip the next two sections. Otherwise, just read 
on, and I’ll do my best to fill you in on what you need to know.</p>

<h3 id="measuring-the-strength-of-relationships-between-datasets">Measuring the strength of relationships between datasets</h3>

<p>Put simply, correlation measures the dependency relationship between two
datasets. When two datasets are fully dependent on each other, there
exists a pattern which can be used to predict the elements in either set
based on the elements in the other. When datasets are completely independent 
from one another, it is impossible to come up with a mapping between 
them that describes their relationship any better than a completely 
randomized mapping would. Virtually all real world datasets that are not 
generated from purely mathematical models fall somewhere between these 
two extremes, and that means that in practice correlation needs to be 
treated as continuum rather than a boolean property. This relative dependency
relationship between datasets is typically represented by a correlation coefficient.</p>

<p>Correlation coefficients can be computed in a number of ways, but the most
common and straightforward way of doing so is by establishing a trend line
and then calculating how closely the data fits that line on average. 
This measure is called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient">Pearson correlation coefficient</a>, 
and is denoted by the variable <code>r</code>.</p>

<p>When two datasets are perfectly linearly correlated, the mapping
between them is perfectly described by a straight line. However, when no 
correlation exists, there will be no meaningful linear pattern to the data at all. An
example of both extremes is shown below; the graph on the left describes perfect
correlation, and the graph on the right describes (almost) no correlation:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/G1laY.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Notice that in the graph on the left, each and every point is perfectly
predicted by the line, but in the graph on the right, there is little to
separate the trend line shown from any other arbitrary line you could draw
through the data. If we compute the correlation coefficient for these
two examples, the left diagram has <code>r=1</code>, and the
right diagram is very close to <code>r=0</code>.</p>

<p>Real world data tends to be noisy, and so in practice you only find datasets
with correlation coefficients of 0.0 or 1.0 in deterministic mathematical
models. With that in mind, the following example shows a messy but strongly 
correlated dataset, with a coefficient of <code>r=0.767</code>:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/TauIx.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You can see from this graph that while the trend line does not directly
predict where the points will fall in the scatter plot, it reflects the
pattern exhibited by the data, and most of the
points within the image fall within a short distance of that line. Taken
together with its relatively high correlation coefficient, this picture
shows a fairly strong relationship between the two datasets.</p>

<p>If you are struggling with mapping the concept of correlation
coefficients to real world relations, it may help to consider the 
following examples (from the book <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow">Thinking, Fast and
Slow</a>):</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The correlation between the size of objects measured in English units
or metric units is 1. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The correlation between SAT scores and college GPA is close to 0.60.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The correlation between income and education level in the United States is
close to 0.40.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The correlation between family income and the last four digits of their
phone number is 0.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We’ll talk more about what correlation does and does not measure in a little
while, but for now we can move on to discuss what separates genuine 
patterns from coincidences. </p>

<h3 id="establishing-a-confidence-factor-for-your-results">Establishing a confidence factor for your results</h3>

<p>Because correlation only establishes the relationships between samples in
an individual experiment, it is important to sanity check your findings
to see how likely it will be that they will hold in future trials. When 
combined with other considerations, statistical significance testing 
can be a useful way of verifying that what you have observed is more than 
pure happenstance.</p>

<p>Methods for testing statistical significance can vary depending on the
relationships you are trying to verify, but they ultimately boil down to being a
way of computing the probability that you would have achieved the same results
by chance. This is done by assuming a default position called a null
hypothesis, and then examining the likelihood that the same results would be
observed if that effect held true.</p>

<p>In the context of correlation testing, the null hypothesis is that your two
datasets are completely independent from one another. Assuming independence
allows you to compute the probability that the effect you observed in 
your real data could be reproduced by chance. The result of this computation 
is called a p-value, and is denoted by the variable <code>p</code>.  </p>

<p>Whether or not a p-value implies statistical significance depends on the context
of what is being studied. For example, in behavioral sciences, a significance 
test that yields a value of <code>p=0.05</code> is typically considered to be a solid 
result. The data from behavioral experiments is extremely noisy and hard to
isolate, and that makes it reasonable from a practical standpoint to accept a
1 in 20 chance that the same correlation could have been observed in 
completely independent datasets. However, in more stable environments, a much
higher standard is imposed. For particle physics discoveries (such as that of
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson">Higgs Boson</a>), a significance 
of 5-sigma is expected, which is approximately <code>p = 0.0000003</code>. These kinds of 
discoveries have less than 1 in 3.5 million chance of being reproduced by 
happenstance, which is an extremely robust result.</p>

<p>The important thing to note about statistical significance is that it can
neither imply the likelihood that an observed result was a fluke, nor can it be
used to verify the validity of an observed pattern. While significance testing
has value as a loose metric for establishing confidence in the plausibility of a
result, it is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_value#Misunderstandings">frequently misunderstood</a> 
to mean much more than that. This point is important to keep in mind as you
conduct your own experiments or read about what others have studied,
because cargo cult science is every bit as dangerous as cargo cult programming.</p>

<h3 id="exploring-statistical-concepts-in-practice">Exploring statistical concepts in practice</h3>

<p>Now that we’ve caught up with all the background knowledge, we can finally dig
into a practical example of how to make use of these ideas. I will start by 
showing you the results of my experiment, and then discuss how I went about 
implementing it. </p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/elm-city-craftworks/olympics/blob/master/olympic_report.pdf?raw=true">The full report is a four page
PDF</a>, 
covering the 1996, 2000, 2004, and 2008 Summer Olympic games. The following 
screenshot shows the Beijing 2008 page, which includes 
a pair of scatterplots and their associated <code>r</code> and <code>p</code> values. For this 
dataset, I analyzed 152 teams, excluding all those that were missing either
GDP or population information in my raw data:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/c25L6.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>What this report shows is that there is a strong correlation between a nation’s
GDP and its Olympic medal wins (<code>r ~= 0.832</code>), and a moderate correlation between 
population and medal wins (<code>r ~= 0.494</code>). While there is some variation in these 
effects over the years, the general conclusion remains the same for all four 
of the Olympic games I analyzed, as shown below:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Rw1Y4.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>While it would be possible with some effort to do this kind of data analysis in
pure Ruby, I chose to make use of <a href="https://github.com/alexgutteridge/rsruby">RSRuby</a>
to interface with the R language instead. R is a fantastic language for 
statistics applications, and so it makes sense to use it when you are doing 
this kind of work.</p>

<p>Because my needs were extremely simple, I did not need to write much glue code
to get what I needed from R. In fact, the complete implementation of my 
<code>Olympics::Analysis</code> singleton object ended up being just a couple paragraphs
of code, as shown below:</p>

<p>In the <code>Olympics::Analysis#correlation</code> method, I make a call to 
R’s <a href="http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/stats/html/cor.test.html">cor.test</a>
function via an RSRuby object, and it returns a nested 
hash containing way more information that what I could possibly 
need for the purposes of this report. With that in mind, I grab
the two values I need from that structure and return a hash with
the values of the <code>n</code>, <code>r</code>, and <code>p</code> variables.</p>

<p>In the <code>Olympics::Analysis#plot</code> method, I call a few R functions to 
generate a scatter-plot with a line of best fit in JPEG format. The
way that R handles graphing is a bit weird, but it 
is extremely powerful. The thing I found particularly interesting as 
someone new to R is that its <a href="http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/stats/html/lm.html">linear modeling functions</a> 
use a formulaic syntax to define custom models for plotting trend 
lines. For our purposes, the simple <code>y ~ x</code> relationship works 
fine, but complicated fit lines can also be described using this 
syntax. As a special-purpose language, this is perhaps not surprising, 
but I found it fascinating from a design perspective.</p>

<p>The rest of the code involved in generating these reports is just a hodgepodge
of miscellaneous data munging, using the CSV standard library to read data in as
a table, and access it by column. For example, I’m able to get all of the
country names by executing the following code:</p>

<div class="highlighter-coderay"><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>&gt;&gt; table = <span style="color:#036;font-weight:bold">CSV</span>.table(<span style="background-color:hsla(0,100%,50%,0.05)"><span style="color:#710">&quot;</span><span style="color:#D20">data/1996_combined.csv</span><span style="color:#710">&quot;</span></span>, <span style="color:#A60">:headers</span> =&gt; <span style="color:#069">true</span>)
&gt;&gt; table[<span style="color:#A60">:noc</span>]
=&gt; [<span style="background-color:hsla(0,100%,50%,0.05)"><span style="color:#710">&quot;</span><span style="color:#D20">Afghanistan</span><span style="color:#710">&quot;</span></span>, <span style="background-color:hsla(0,100%,50%,0.05)"><span style="color:#710">&quot;</span><span style="color:#D20">Albania</span><span style="color:#710">&quot;</span></span>, ..., <span style="background-color:hsla(0,100%,50%,0.05)"><span style="color:#710">&quot;</span><span style="color:#D20">Zambia</span><span style="color:#710">&quot;</span></span>, <span style="background-color:hsla(0,100%,50%,0.05)"><span style="color:#710">&quot;</span><span style="color:#D20">Zimbabwe</span><span style="color:#710">&quot;</span></span>]
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The CSV standard library really makes this kind of work easy, and its <code>Table</code>
object even automatically converts numeric columns into their appropriate 
Ruby objects by default:</p>

<div class="highlighter-coderay"><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>&gt;&gt; table[<span style="color:#A60">:all_medals</span>].reduce(<span style="color:#A60">:+</span>)
=&gt; <span style="color:#00D">837</span>
</pre></div>

<p>I won’t go into much of the details about the reporting code used to 
generate the PDF, because it isn’t especially related to the main topic of this 
article. However, it is worth pointing out that in order to make the data
I got back from <code>Olympic::Analysis.correlation</code> display friendly, I needed to 
do some extra transformations on it:</p>

<p>The formatting of the <code>n</code> and <code>r</code> values are very straightforward, and so it
should be clear what is going on there. However, to display <code>p</code> in a way that
is consistent with statistical reporting, I need to check to see if its value
is lower than the threshold I’ve chosen, and display <code>p &lt; 0.001</code> rather
than <code>p ~= 0.000</code>. This requires just a little bit of extra effort, but it makes
the report a whole lot nicer looking.</p>

<p>I had originally planned to show all of these values out to float precision, but
it turns out that R’s <code>cor.test</code> function returns <code>p=0</code> for any value of <code>p</code>
that is smaller than hardware float epsilon. This is a bit of an awkward
behavior, and so I was happy to sidestep it by displaying an inequality 
instead. For what it’s worth, the inner math geek in me cringes at the 
idea of displaying arbitrarily small values in the neighborhood of zero 
as if they were actually zeroes.</p>

<p>While it isn’t especially important for understanding the main concepts in this
article, if you feel like you want to know how this report works, 
you can start with the <a href="https://github.com/elm-city-craftworks/olympics/blob/master/olympic_report.rb">olympic_report.rb</a> 
script and then trace the path of execution from there through to the actual
PDF generation. If you have questions about its implementation, feel free
to leave me a comment.</p>

<p>So far, I have provided you with some very basic background information on a
couple of statistical methods, and demonstrated how to make use of them in
practice. However, what I haven’t spent much time talking about is all the
things that can go wrong when you do this kind of analysis. Let’s take a bit
of time now to discuss that before we wrap things up.</p>

<h3 id="maintaining-a-healthy-level-of-skepticism">Maintaining a healthy level of skepticism</h3>

<p>In the process of researching this article, I learned that even statisticians
can be a bit trollish from time to time. If you don’t believe me, take a look at
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet">Anscombe’s Quartet</a>:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/0QV6V.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>All four of these figures have an identical trend line, and an identical
correlation (<code>r = 0.816</code>), as well as several other properties in common.
However, visual inspection reveals that they are clearly displaying wildly
different patterns from one another. The point of this diagram is obvious: 
simple statistics on their own are no substitute for actually
looking at what the data is telling you.</p>

<p>With this idea in mind, it is important to take a close look at the patterns you see
in your data, and look for outliers and groups of points that may be skewing
results. If excluding those values keeps the effect that you observed intact,
you can feel a bit more confident in the strength of your evidence. However, if
your effect disappears, that means you may need to do some thinking about why
that is the case, and possibly come up with some new questions to ask.</p>

<p>Looking back at my report, it is easy to spot a few things
that could influence its results:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/AJdUf.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>To see how what effect these factors were having on my results, I re-ran the
correlation and significance calculations on a number of variations of the
original Beijing 2008 dataset:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/lvVrX.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>All of the variations left the strong correlation between GDP and medal wins
intact, although some changes did make some major impacts on the <code>r</code> value. This
tells me that at least for the issues we identified, the trend is fairly
robust.</p>

<p>The relationship between population and medal wins is less
stable, and simply excluding the US and China data points pushes it to the point
of not having much of a correlation at all. When removing all the major
identified influencing factors, the moderate correlation is preserved, 
but we end up with <code>p=0.002</code>. While it seems reasonable to accept 1 in
500 odds on a dataset that is bound to be influenced by any number of external
factors, this result does still stand out when you note that most of our other
p-values were infinitesimal.</p>

<p>Even if we accept that this investigation seems to support the notion of a
strong link between GDP and Olympic medal wins, and a somewhat dubious but plausible
relationship between population and Olympic medal wins, we still need to think
of all of the things that could of gone wrong before we even reached the point
of conducting our analysis. Without knowing that our source data is reliable, we
can’t trust the results of our analysis.</p>

<p>The data I used for this report is cobbled together from CSVs I found via
web search, scraped data from Wikipedia, and copy and pasted data from
Wikipedia. To assemble the combined CSV documents that these reports run
against, I wrote a bunch of small throwaway scripts and wasn’t particularly
careful about avoiding data loss or corruption in the process. So in the end,
there is a very real possibility that the effect I found means nothing at all.</p>

<p>The lesson to take away from this point about data integrity is that fitness for
purpose should always be on your mind. If you are throwing together a couple
graphs to get a rough picture of a phenomenon to see if there is anything
interesting worth saying about it, then you probably don’t need to worry about
hunting down perfectly clean data and processing it flawlessly. However, if you
are tasked with building a statistical report which is actually meant to
influence people in some way, or to inform a decision making process, you need
to double and triple check that you’re not feeding garbage data into your
analysis process. In other words, statistics can only be as reliable as the
raw facts you use to generate them.</p>

<p>If we suppose that the raw data for this report was accurate in the first place, 
was not corrupted in the process of analyzing it, and that the results we 
generated are significant and trustworthy, we still must accept that 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_is_not_causation">correlation does not imply
causation</a>.
Nonetheless, knowing what patterns exist out there in the world can be very
helpful to us as we contemplate <em>why</em> things are the way they are, and that
makes these very simple statistical methods useful in their own right.</p>

<h3 id="reflections">Reflections</h3>

<p>While I hope that this article has some direct practical value for you, now that
I have written it I feel that it is just as useful as an exercise in developing
a more rigorous and skeptical way of thinking about the work that we do. </p>

<p>On the one hand, statistics offers us the promise that we can make sense of the myriad
data streams that make up our lives. On the other hand, statistical thinking
requires us to be precise, diligent, and realistic about what we can expect to 
understand about the world. These kinds of mental states overlap nicely with
what helps us become better at programming, and I think that is what made
writing this article so interesting to me. I hope you enjoyed it too!</p>
